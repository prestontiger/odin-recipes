    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4><strong>Prepare the Quinoa:</strong></h4><ul>
            <li>Rinse quinoa under cold water in a fine mesh strainer.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of vegetable broth to a boil. Add the quinoa, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.</li>
        </ul></li>

        <li><h4><strong>Prepare the Bell Peppers:</strong></h4><ul>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Place the peppers in a baking dish, cut-side up. Lightly brush the outsides of the peppers with olive oil.</li>
        </ul></li>
        
        <li><h4><strong>Make the Filling:</strong></h4><ul>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add a splash of olive oil, then sauté the onion, garlic, and jalapeño (if using) until soft, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the cooked quinoa, black beans, corn, diced tomatoes, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in the chopped cilantro.</li>
        </ul></li>

        <li><h4><strong>Stuff the Peppers:</strong></h4><ul>
            <li>Spoon the quinoa mixture into each bell pepper cavity, pressing down as needed to fill completely.</li>
        </ul></li>

        <li><h4><strong>Bake:</strong></h4><ul>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for about 30 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the filling is heated through.</li>
        </ul></li>

        <li><h4><strong>Serve:</strong></h4><ul>
            <li>Allow the peppers to cool slightly before serving. Garnish with avocado slices and a dollop of vegan sour cream. Enjoy your vibrant and flavorful Quinoa Stuffed Bell Peppers with a Southwest Twist!</li>
