Welcome to my demonstration project, crafted to showcase the HTML skills I've acquired through the Odin Project. This website is a curated collection of simple yet enticing recipes.

Each recipe, along with its accompanying images, has been creatively generated using ChatGPT. The coding behind this site, from structure to style, is entirely my own work.

This project not only reflects my journey in learning HTML but also demonstrates my ability to integrate AI-generated content into a cohesive and functional web design. Enjoy exploring these delicious recipes and the technology that brought them to life.
